## Project: tcheck

tCheck is a desktop application that offers an integrated system to efficiently manage a bubble tea shop, of the (imaginary) brand T-sugar, by providing sales tracking, ingredient tracking and manpower management. It is optimized for CLI users to update and retrieve the information more efficiently.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=persdre&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2`
  * Managed DDLs
 
* **Added emergency contact placeholder in employees' contact details**: Allows users to add employees' emergency contact by using `c-add`. Emergency contact's information can be edited by `c-edit`.
- Add information about myself


<!-- * **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()
